                <h1>Honey Infused Hair Oil</h1>
                <div class="ingredient-info">
                    <p>Our signature hair oil blends Mirsalehi honey from our family bee garden with argan oil and coconut oil. The honey is carefully harvested using sustainable methods that protect our bees while ensuring the highest quality.</p>
                    <p>We combine this with cold-pressed argan oil from Morocco and organic coconut oil from Sri Lanka. These oils are gently mixed at low temperatures to preserve their natural benefits.</p>
                    <p>The formula includes vitamin E as a natural preservative and rosemary extract for scalp stimulation. No synthetic fragrances are added - only the natural honey scent.</p>
                    <p>Each batch is hand-bottled in our Amsterdam facility using recyclable glass packaging. The amber glass protects the oils from sunlight degradation.</p>

                <h1>Propolis Infused Primer</h1>
                <div class="ingredient-info">
                    <p>This smoothing primer features our proprietary propolis extract combined with hyaluronic acid and squalane. The propolis is collected from our bee hives and processed within 24 hours to preserve its active compounds.</p>
                    <p>We blend it with plant-derived hyaluronic acid from fermented wheat and olive-derived squalane. The formula includes natural silica for pore-blurring effects.</p>
                    <p>The lightweight emulsion is created through cold-processing to maintain ingredient potency. We avoid synthetic emulsifiers, using instead a natural lecithin base.</p>
                    <p>Packaged in airless pump bottles to prevent contamination, each primer is tested for texture and performance before shipping.</p>

                <h1>Hair Perfume</h1>
                <div class="ingredient-info">
                    <p>Our alcohol-free hair perfume starts with a base of floral waters - rose from Bulgaria and orange blossom from Tunisia. These are steam-distilled to capture their delicate fragrances.</p>
                    <p>We add honey-derived compounds for scent fixation and hair benefits. The formula includes panthenol (pro-vitamin B5) for strengthening and aloe vera for hydration.</p>
                    <p>Essential oils of vanilla, bergamot and ylang-ylang are carefully blended to create our signature scent. These are diluted in a jojoba oil base for safe application.</p>
                    <p>The perfume is bottled in recyclable glass with fine mist sprayers for even distribution. Each batch is macerated for 4 weeks to develop the full fragrance profile.</p>

                <div class="ingredient-info">
                    <p>This intensive treatment combines honey, royal jelly and beeswax from our hives with shea butter and mango butter. The butters are cold-pressed to preserve their nourishing properties.</p>
                    <p>We add hydrolyzed wheat proteins for strengthening and coconut milk for hydration. The formula includes natural emulsifiers from sugar derivatives.</p>
                    <p>Each component is slowly heated to precise temperatures (never above 40Â°C) to maintain efficacy. The mixture is then cooled while stirring to create our signature creamy texture.</p>
                    <p>Packaged in biodegradable jars with recycled paper labels, the mask is free from silicones, parabens and synthetic dyes.</p>
